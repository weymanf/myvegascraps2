# Welcome to My Vegas Craps 2

Alright folks. Let us forget the embarassment of the first one. I have long since forgotten it, and that project was written in ruby, my old favorite language at the time.
This is the new and improved react version for IOS and Android. 

Honestly, I'm just using this as a fun project to learn React Native, and generally start my own project from start to finish again.

I wasn't sure if I was going to make this in unity but I wanted to leverage my experience with javascript and Full stack development.
I probably will use the basic business logic of everything built here and eventually translated it the a playable game with 3D Models (Don't hold your breath).

## Future and Unreachable Goals

1. Lol finish the god damn craps game.
1.5. Translate it to web. As well using react-native-web. God damn I need to switch the router.
2. Use dice physics instead of Math.random to generate the probabiliy of rolling dice. 
    - I'll probably combine some sort of physics math combining strength and trajectory
    - using node streams to detect x-y-z motion and have SVGs of dice drawn/animated as it flies through the air. Yolo.
3. Create Multiplayer. Probably put this before the whole dice thing. I want to test out grpc and stream the game live.
4. Skin game. Every game got to have that skin game. Fuzzy fucking dice.
5. Eventually the money used in this game will be used for a Tower Defense game I will soon write (lol never).
6. Blockchain
